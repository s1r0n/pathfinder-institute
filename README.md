# Global Pathfinder Institute

The **Global Pathfinder Institute (GPI)** is the research, design, and implementation engine of the **Pathfinder Educational Model (PEM)** — a post-industrial, trauma-informed, and healing-centered curriculum system developed to address the failure of conventional education to support human flourishing, planetary stewardship, and post-capitalist transformation.

This repository houses the digital, curricular, and ontological infrastructure required to **create, distribute, and support PEM-aligned learning across global contexts**.

---

## Mission

To develop and distribute scalable, empirically grounded, and ethically structured curriculum designed to:

- Satisfy the **Seven Essential Needs** of human beings
- Promote **healing**, **connection**, and **empowerment**
- Cultivate **systems thinking**, **emotional intelligence**, and **ecological literacy**
- Support the emergence of a **life-centered, post-capitalist planetary civilization**

---

## Core Responsibilities

The Global Pathfinder Institute:

- Curates and maintains the **Pathfinder Curriculum**, including:
  - **Foundational Domains** (e.g., human needs, cognitive development)
  - **Core Domains** (e.g., psychology, history, ecology)
  - **Specialized Tracks** (e.g., trauma healing, relational ethics, eco-civics)
- Develops modular **Learning Series** for implementation in Pods and Hubs
- Integrates *Pathfinder AI™* to support dynamic, personalized learning
- Ensures alignment with the **Pathfinder Pedagogical Framework**, including:
  - The **Four-Point Foundation**
  - The **Seven Pillars of Authentic Learning**
  - **Life-Affirming Architecture** and **Trauma-Informed Design**
