>To my knowledge, no class can hold State power over a long period without at the same time exercising its hegemony over and in the State Ideological Apparatuses. I only need one example and proof of this: Lenin’s anguished concern to revolutionize the educational Ideological State Apparatus... simply to make it possible for the Soviet proletariat, who had seized State power, to secure the future of the... proletariat and the transition to socialism.

# The Pathfinder Institute

## Mission & Vision

​	The Pathfinder Institute is a decentralized pedagogical research and development hub dedicated to fostering holistic, ethical, and transformative education. Anchored in the Pathfinder Model, it supports educators, learners, and communities seeking to co-create a future-oriented, spiritually and socially aligned approach to learning.

​	The Pathfinder mission is to dismantle oppressive educational systems and replace them with relational, decolonial, and integrative frameworks that empower all learners to reclaim their developmental trajectory, connect deeply to self and world, and fulfill their archetypal roles within an emerging [Harmonic Social Structure](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Harmonic_Social_Structure). 

> [!NOTE]
>
> A **Harmonic Social Structure (HSS)** is a social, economic, and political configuration consciously designed to promote individual and collective [Human Flourishing](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Flourishing), facilitate the realization of full [Human Potential](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Potential), and support the health and well-being of the planet. A HSS stands in contrast to  hierarchical, oppressive, and exploitative social systems (e.g., capitalism, feudalism, theocracy). For more, see its [SpiritWiki entry](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org).
