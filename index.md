# The Pathfinder Institute

The Pathfinder Institute serves as the overarching accrediting and governing body of the [Pathfinder Educational Model](/assets/files/1-pem.pdf). It is composed of a diverse cross-section of experts, scholars, parents, teachers, business leaders, and community stakeholders. If you would like to contribute by becoming a committee member, contact mikes@athabascau.ca

## Mission & Vision

​	The Pathfinder Institute is a decentralized pedagogical research and development hub dedicated to fostering holistic, ethical, and transformative education. Anchored in the Pathfinder Model, it supports educators, learners, and communities seeking to co-create a future-oriented, spiritually and socially aligned approach to learning.

​	The Pathfinder mission is to dismantle oppressive educational systems and replace them with relational, decolonial, and integrative frameworks that empower all learners to reclaim their developmental trajectory, connect deeply to self and world, and fulfill their archetypal roles within an emerging [Harmonic Social Structure](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Harmonic_Social_Structure).

> A **Harmonic Social Structure (HSS)** is a social, economic, and political configuration consciously designed to promote individual and collective [Human Flourishing](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Flourishing), facilitate the realization of full [Human Potential](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Potential), and support the health and well-being of the planet. In contrast to hierarchical, oppressive, and exploitative social systems (e.g., capitalism, feudalism, theocracy), an HSS ensures the satisfaction of all [Seven Essential Needs](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Seven_Essential_Needs) and removes the [Five Barriers to Human Flourishing](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Five_Barriers_to_Human_Flourishing). Harmonic Social Structures are aligned with the principles of the [Lightning Path Human Development Framework](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Lightning_Path_Human_Development_Framework) **(HDF)** and are necessary to support safe, healthy, and accelerated [Human Development](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Human_Development) across all aspects: [Healing](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Healing), [Alignment](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Alignment), [Connection](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Connection), [Integration](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Integration), [Empowerment](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Empowerment), [Perfection](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Perfection), and [Transformation](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Transformation) (i.e., the [Seven Components of Human Development](https://spiritwiki.lightningpath.org/index.php/Seven_Components_of_Human_Development)),
